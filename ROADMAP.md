# Roadmap

Rough order, not a contract. See `adr/` for the decisions behind these.

## Now
- [x] Prove the pipeline: FASTFFS → WASM, driven against the JS NOR device (`npm run test:fastffs`).
- [x] **Wire the visualizer to the live device event stream.** `runner.js` loads
      `dist/fastffs.mjs`, attaches `device.js`, and `viz.js` replays `prog`/`erase`/`read`
      events onto the die. Fills reconstruct from real events; write-amp / erases / violations
      are read off the device.
- [x] **Playground:** control panel (write / gc / format) plus a JS console over the FS API,
      with a self-pacing auto-workload.

## Next
- [x] Simulated flash timing (ESP32-S3 preset) + timed playback + per-op timing log.
- [x] Inspect: per-sector roles (index / live / obsolete / erased) via footer decode; live·garbage·free bar.
- [x] **Per-record obsolete coloring.** `fffs_inspect_live_map` (added to FASTFFS on branch
      `flashvis-live-map`, reusing its reachability walk) yields a per-page erased/metadata/
      obsolete/live map; the die tints each page and the live·garbage bar is now exact.
- [x] **Background-GC ratio slider.** Workload splits between foreground file ops and
      background GC steps; turn GC down to watch FASTFFS fall into foreground/inline GC —
      write times spike in the op log and garbage piles up.
- [x] **Timed playback + await-pacing.** Ops cost real ESP32-S3 flash time; a timed player
      scales them to real time (SPEED: slow-mo → real-time → no-delay); `await fs.op()` blocks
      for the op's simulated time. See [ADR-0009](adr/0009-timed-playback-and-pacing.md).
- [x] **Streaming `ls`** via the `fffs_dir_open`/`dir_read`/`dir_close` iterator — entries
      stream at sim pace instead of one blob.
- [x] **Churn-model file tracking** (`runner.names()`) — the workload and Delete pick from a
      recorded file set, so a step never scans the directory first.
- [x] **`fffs_inspect_live_map` upstreamed to FASTFFS `main`** (`c18ab22`, pushed to
      `origin`). A fresh clone now gets per-page obsolete coloring; the parent gitlink already
      pointed at this SHA, so no submodule bump was needed.
- [x] Strip the now-dead CSS in `index.html`: `@keyframes prog/ping/erase-wash` plus the
      `.cell.prog`/`.cell.ping`/`.sector.erasing` rules, moving the op glows into JS. (Read/prog
      then moved *again*, off one Web-Animations object per op to a coalesced per-cell heat
      field, to kill a ~1 s burst-freeze; only the erase sweep still animates via the Web
      Animations API — see [ADR-0022](adr/0022-coalesced-heat-render.md).)
- [x] **Port the FASTFFS churn model to JS** (`web/src/churn.js`). Byte-exact PRNG/event
      sequence (reproduces FASTFFS benchmark runs; feeds every FS the same logical workload for
      lockstep), idiomatic JS above the PRNG. A target live size fills toward a steady state
      instead of monotonically overfilling. See [ADR-0010](adr/0010-churn-model-in-js.md).
- [x] **Console FS API sweep.** A two-tier console surface — friendly top-level pokes
      (`writeFile`/`readFile`/`deleteFile`/`ls`/`getFiles`, all paced, returning descriptors so a
      script self-tracks) over a raw handle-based `fs.` layer (`fs.open`/`fs.openDir` file/dir
      proxies with partial/seeked I/O, stat, prefix), on a static handle pool in the shim, plus a
      setup-mode toggle. Brings the shim ABI to its final shape **before** LittleFS, so the second
      driver is built against it. See [ADR-0014](adr/0014-console-fs-api.md).
- [x] **Integrate LittleFS**: submodule under `fs/littlefs/`, a `bindings/littlefs/shim.c`
      onto the same three HAL imports and the uniform shim ABI ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-uniform-fs-driver-abi.md)),
      WASM build, plus a native `lfs_inspect.c` liveness hook ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-per-fs-liveness-inspect.md)).
- [x] **UI: switch filesystem implementation.** A control to pick which FS drives the die;
      switching is simple — fresh state, no cross-FS carryover. Rides on the FS-agnostic
      `runner.js` from [ADR-0011](adr/0011-uniform-fs-driver-abi.md). See
      [ADR-0015](adr/0015-session-manager-and-executor-seam.md) (session/manager split) and
      [ADR-0016](adr/0016-lockstep-coordinator.md) (the picker became a multi-select once
      lockstep landed — see below).
- [x] **UI: lockstep multiple filesystems.** Run the same deterministic churn workload across
      several FS implementations in parallel; the UI switches which die/log view is shown (each
      FS has its own timing, so logs and playback pace differ). Two modes:
  - **Race** — each FS runs the workload as fast as possible; monitor their progress against
    each other.
  - **Pace** — the simulation paces to the slowest FS so all stay at the same workload step
    (files in sync, die images directly comparable), while tracking each FS's total active time.

      A coordinator (`web/src/lockstep.js`) generates one canonical, seeded step sequence and
      gives every participating session its own cursor into it — Race gates each session on its
      own player draining, Pace barrier-syncs every session per step. See
      [ADR-0016](adr/0016-lockstep-coordinator.md).
- [ ] **Churn workload tuning knobs.** Expose the churn model's parameters in the UI — target
      live size, file-size distribution, create/replace/delete mix, seed — so the workload can be
      shaped (and reproduced) instead of hardcoded. (Later — the hardcoded model is fine for
      testing as is; this is more an exploration nicety.) Note: the over-capacity LARGE class
      (350 KiB writes on a 256 KiB chip) is disabled (`weight: 0` in `playground.js`) until these
      knobs land — re-enable it as a knob then.
- [x] **About-filesystems explainer.** An in-app primer: how NOR flash works (erase-before-write,
      sector/page granularity, wear, `0xFF` as the erased state), and how each filesystem copes with
      those limits (log-structured writes, wear-leveling, garbage collection). The garbage% story
      lives here — it's GC-ratio-dependent, FASTFFS's background GC keeps it low (so the 50% default
      undersells it), and the residual is compaction-only, run under allocation pressure. (Being
      extended to cover the three drivers below.)

## Borrow from FASTFFS later
The FASTFFS repo has more reusable workload and fault machinery worth pulling rather than
reinventing (the churn model and VFS workloads are already promoted into **Next** above):
- `tools/fffs_api_crash_sweep.c` — simulates partial writes / power loss during churn; the basis
  for a future crash-safety / recovery visualization (nothing on the near roadmap models this yet).
- `benchmarks/esp32s3_*` — more real device configs. The ESP32-S3 *timing* preset is already
  mirrored in `device.js`; these would seed a preset picker if we revisit configurable geometry.

## Later filesystems
Behind the same shim contract (`fs/*/`) — once LittleFS proves the second-driver path and the
switch/lockstep UI above, adding more drivers is mechanical. Each mirrors the library the FASTFFS
ESP32-S3 benchmark suite integrated (`fs/fastffs/benchmarks/esp32s3_*`), so flashvis visualizes the
same code that was benchmarked — and each already has a `benchfs_ops_t` backend adapter there whose
op set our shim ABI mines ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-uniform-fs-driver-abi.md)), so the adapter is largely
reusable. Only the FS core is load-bearing; the surrounding ESP-IDF VFS/POSIX plumbing is scaffolding
a bare WASM embedding replaces itself.

- [x] **SPIFFS** — [pellepl/spiffs](https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs) (MIT; ESP-IDF vendors a
      lightly-patched fork). Easiest port, the LittleFS bar: NOR-native, driven by an injectable
      `spiffs_config` HAL (`hal_read_f` / `hal_write_f` / `hal_erase_f`) that maps one-to-one onto
      the shim's read / prog / erase. **Landed:** upstream submodule at `fs/spiffs`, benchmark
      tuning mirrored (incl. ESP-IDF's buffer derivations), true 1:1 per-page live map off the
      object-lookup tables, and `SPIFFS_gc_quick(0)` as a genuinely bounded `ff_gc_step`
      (ADR-0021 bar met — caps GC|LIVE_MAP|APPEND).
- [x] **JesFS** — [joembedded/JesFs](https://github.com/joembedded/JesFs) (MIT; the benchmark pins
      `3a1dff76` as a submodule). NOR/SPI-native; its HAL is SPI-*command* level (RDID / page-program
      / 4 KiB-erase opcodes) rather than read / prog / erase — but the benchmark already ships both
      adapters we'd reuse: a JesFS→`benchfs_ops_t` common-API adapter (`esp32s3_jesfs/main/main.c`)
      whose op set our shim already mirrors, and a fake-SPI lower layer (`jesfs_ll_esp_partition.c`)
      that already decodes the SPI opcodes into block read/prog/erase. Porting is mostly swapping its
      bottom `esp_partition_read/write/erase_range` for the three HAL imports (and answering RDID with
      a plausible JEDEC id/density) — not writing a shim from scratch. **Landed:** submodule pinned at
      the benchmark SHA, both adapters ported (RDID answers as an MX25R2035F, density 0x12), seek
      emulated by rewind+re-read, sector-magic live map; caps LIVE_MAP only (reclamation is inline
      just-in-time — no churn-safe GC step, per ADR-0021). Generated workload names (≤18 chars) fit
      its 21-char limit.
- [x] **FAT + FTL** — two stacked libraries, mirroring the benchmark's `esp_vfs_fat_spiflash_mount_rw_wl`:
  - **[ChaN FatFs](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/)** (BSD-1-clause-style) — portable ANSI-C, but does
    no erase and no wear-leveling: it expects an overwrite-in-place block device via `disk_read` /
    `disk_write` (512 B logical sectors). Inert over raw NOR without the layer beneath it.
  - **FTL — ESP-IDF `wear_levelling`** (Apache-2.0) — the sector-remap wear-leveling layer FatFs
    rides on; it, not FatFs, owns erase. Caveat: **no standalone upstream** — it lives only inside
    `espressif/esp-idf` (`components/wear_levelling/`, C++), so "the same library" means lifting an
    IDF component and re-stubbing its `Flash_Access` backend onto the three HAL imports. Highest
    effort of the four; NOR-oriented, so no NAND mismatch (Dhara was considered and ruled out for
    exactly that reason).

    Stack: FatFs `disk_read` / `disk_write` (512 B) → `wear_levelling` remap → NOR read / prog / erase.

    **Landed** (displayed as "FatFs + WL", name provisional): both cores vendored byte-identical to
    ESP-IDF v5.3.2 (`9d7f2d6`; FatFs is ChaN R0.15p2 — IDF's copy chosen over an elm-chan archive
    because it *is* what the benchmark ran and its `ff.c` is stock ChaN; verified by diff against the
    pinned commit). WL core unmodified — only the `Flash_Access` backend re-stubbed onto the HAL; the
    inspect hook reaches WL's logical→physical map via a subclass, composing the FAT12 view through
    it. 4 KiB WL sectors, two FATs, LFN enabled (the shared workload's names exceed 8.3); 4 sectors
    WL overhead → 240 KiB logical volume, ~224 KiB usable (~2.3× the churn steady state). Caps
    APPEND|LIVE_MAP — no GC concept (ADR-0021). Same 3000-op churn costs ~14.6k erases vs FASTFFS's
    ~1k: the write-amplification centerpiece.
